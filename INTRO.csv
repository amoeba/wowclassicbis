"About this workbook:
This is a more up to date version of some of the other item EP value BiS lists.  Just like the others, it uses a static EP value to determine the value of an item. Please view the EPV sheet for current values and credit from where I gathered information for each.
Set bonuses are not included in any item value.  It's up to you to factor them in.
