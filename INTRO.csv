"About this workbook:
This is a more up to date version of some of the other item EP value BiS lists.  Just like the others, it uses a static EP value to determine the value of an item. Please view the EPV sheet for current values and credit from where I gathered information for each.
Set bonuses are not included in any item value.  It's up to you to factor them in.

Hello everyone!  Thank you so much for your continued use and support during TBC!  There are currently no plans on making this style of sheet for WotLK, 
I recommend using your class discords to get the most up to date information and spreadsheets on the gear you can  be using.  Thanks again!"

"DISCLAIMER:  PLEASE REMEMBER EP VALUES AND STAT WEIGHTS FLUCTUATE DEPENDING ON THE GEAR YOU HAVE. While the weights do not usually fluctuate too much, please use more as a general guide and not gospel. If you would like more information please read the article below.
