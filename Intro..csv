"About this workbook:
This is a more up to date version of some of the other item EP value BiS lists.  Just like the others, it uses a static EP value to determine the value of an item. Please view the EPV sheet for current values and credit from where I gathered information for each.
Set bonuses are not included in any item value.  It's up to you to factor them in.

"DISCLAIMER:  PLEASE REMEMBER EP VALUES AND STAT WEIGHTS FLUCTUATE DEPENDING ON THE GEAR YOU HAVE. While the weights do not usually fluctuate too much, please use more as a general guide and not gospel. If you would like more information please read the article below.
