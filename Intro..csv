"About this workbook:
This is a more up to date version of some of the other item EP value BiS lists.  Just like the others, it uses a static EP value to determine the value of an item. The EP values themselves are pulled from different locations,  please view the EPV sheet for current values and credit from where I gathered my information for each.  If you would like an item added please contact me on discord with a link to the item.  Trinket section is a work in progress. Set bonuses are not included in any of the items.  It's up to you to factor them in.

Updated: 6/14/21 - Gems are now rare, not epic.  Thank you for the reminder!"

"DISCLAIMER:  PLEASE REMEMBER EP VALUES AND STAT WEIGHTS FLUCTUATE DEPENDING ON THE GEAR YOU HAVE. While the weights do not usually fluctuate too much, please use more as a general guide and not gospel. If you would like more information please read the article below.
