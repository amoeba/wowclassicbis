"About this workbook:
This is a more up to date version of some of the other item EP value BiS lists.  Just like the others, it uses a static EP value to determine the value of an item. The EP values themselves are pulled from different locations,  please view the EPV sheet for current values and credit from where I gathered my information for each.  If you would like an item added please contact me on discord with a link to the item.  Trinket section is a work in progress. Set bonuses are not included in any of the items. Some set bonuses (like the Malorne [Tier 4] 2-piece bonus) are very good and make those items significantly more valuable in practice than in the lists. However, there is no meaningful way to represent the value on individual items, so it's up to you to factor them in.
